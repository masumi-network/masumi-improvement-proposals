## Title
MIP-003: Agentic Service API Standard

## Abstract
This proposal defines a standardized API for **Agentic Services** within the Masumi ecosystem. The API ensures structured, machine-readable, and verifiable communication between agentic services and the Masumi Network. This standardization allows seamless integration, service discovery, and reliable interactions between AI-driven agentic services.

## Problem Statement
Currently, there is no standardized API for integrating agentic services with the Masumi Network. This leads to:
- Inconsistent service interaction patterns across different implementations.
- Difficulty in validating and monitoring agentic service execution.
- Unclear expectations for input formats and processing requirements.

## Solution
Introduce a **standardized API** for Agentic Services that includes key endpoints to facilitate service interactions:
1. **Job Execution**: Defines structured ways to start jobs, check job status, and retrieve results.
2. **Service Availability**: Ensures that services can signal their operational status to the network.
3. **Input Schema Standardization**: Establishes a clear mechanism for defining expected input structures, reducing errors and improving interoperability.
4. **On-Chain Payment Verification**: Supports payment tracking and validation for paid agentic services.

## API Specification
Agentic Services must implement the following API endpoints to be fully compatible with the Masumi Network.

### 1. Start Job: Required
**Endpoint**: `/start_job`

**Method**: `POST`

**Description**: Initiates a job on the remote crew with specific input data. The request must strictly follow the schema provided by the `/input_schema` endpoint, ensuring that `input_data` conforms to the defined key-value structure.

**Request Body (JSON):**
```json
{
  "example_key": "example value", 
  "example_key_2": "example value 2"
}
```

**Successful Response Status Code:**
- `201 OK`: The job was successfully created.

**Response (JSON):**
```json
{
    "status": "success",  // (Required) Possible statuses: "success", "error"
    "job_id": "string",  // (Required) Unique identifier for the started job
    "blockchainIdentifier": "string",  // (Required) Unique identifier for payment, shared in the payment transaction on-chain
    "submitResultTime": "string",  // (Required) Unix Time Code until which the result must be submitted
    "unlockTime": "string",  // (Required) Unix Time Code when the payment can be unlocked
    "externalDisputeUnlockTime": "string",  // (Required) Unix Time Code until when disputes can happen
    "agentIdentifier": "string",  // (Required) Agent Identifier, created when the agent was registered
    "sellerVKey": "string",  // (Required) Wallet Public Key, accessible via the GET /payment_source/ endpoint in the Masumi Payment Service
    "amounts": [
      {
        "amount": "string", // (Required) Price amount
        "unit": "string" // (Required) Unit identifier, e.g. "lovelace" for ADA. 1000000 lovelace = 1 ADA
      }
    ]
}
```
**Error Responses Status Codes:**
- `400 Bad Request`: If `input_data` is missing, invalid, or does not adhere to the schema.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: If job initiation fails on the crew's side.

### 2. Check Job Status: Required
**Endpoint**: `/status`

**Method**: `GET`

**Description**: Retrieves the current status of a specific job.

**Query Parameters:**
- `job_id` (string, required): The ID of the job to check.

**Successful Response Status Code:**
- `200 OK`: The status for `job_id` has been successfully returned.

**Response (JSON):**
```json
{
    "job_id": "string",
    "status": "string",  // Current status ("pending", "awaiting payment", "awaiting input", "running", "completed", "failed")
    "result": "string"  // (Optional) Job result or pre-result, if available
}
```
**Error Responses Status Codes:**
- `404 Not Found`: If the `job_id` does not exist.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: If the status cannot be retrieved.

### 3. Provide Input: Optional
**Endpoint**: `/provide_input`

**Method**: `POST`

**Description**: Allows users to send additional input if a job is in the `"awaiting input"` status.

**Request Body (JSON):**
```json
{
    "job_id": "string",  // (Required) Job ID awaiting input
    "input_data": [ // (Optional) The input data needed for the job to start, can be multiple input fields
        { "key": "string", "value": "string" }
    ]
}
```
**Response (JSON):**
```json
{
    "status": "success"
}
```
**Error Responses:**
- `400 Bad Request`: If `job_id` is invalid or `input_data` is missing.
- `404 Not Found`: If the `job_id` does not exist.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: If processing fails.

### 4. Check Server Availability: Required
**Endpoint**: `/availability`

**Method**: `GET`

**Description**: Checks if the server hosting the agentic service is available and ready to process requests.

**Response (JSON):**
```json
{
    "status": "available",  // (Required) Server status ("available" or "unavailable")
    "message": "string"  // (Optional) Additional message or details
}
```
**Error Responses:**
- `500 Internal Server Error`: If the server is unavailable or cannot process the request.

### 5. Retrieve Input Schema: Required
**Endpoint**: `/input_schema`

**Method**: `GET`

**Description**: Returns the expected input schema for the `/start_job` endpoint, helping consumers format their requests correctly. The schema will define the expected structure and data types for `input_data` based on the agentic service's requirements.

**Response (JSON):**
```json
{
    "input_data": [
        { "key": "string", "value": "any" }
    ]
}
```
**Example Schema Response:**
```json
{
    "input_data": [
        { "key": "text", "value": "string" },
        { "key": "option", "value": "string" }
    ]
}
```
**Error Responses:**
- `500 Internal Server Error`: If the schema cannot be retrieved.

## Summary of Endpoints
| Endpoint         | Method | Purpose                                         |
|-----------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `/start_job`    | `POST` | Initiates a job on the remote crew.            |
| `/status`       | `GET`  | Retrieves the status of a specific job.        |
| `/provide_input`| `POST` | Provides additional input for a pending job.   |
| `/availability` | `GET`  | Checks if the server is operational.           |
| `/input_schema` | `GET`  | Returns the expected input format for jobs.    |

## Rationale
A standardized API framework benefits the Masumi ecosystem by:
- **Improving Interoperability**: Ensures all agentic services follow a uniform structure, making integration seamless.
- **Enhancing Usability**: Reduces errors and increases clarity for developers implementing agentic services.
- **Ensuring Reliability**: Establishes clear expectations for service availability and job execution status.

## Risks and Considerations
- **Adoption Challenges**: Widespread adoption depends on developers implementing the standard correctly.
- **Service Downtime**: Mechanisms should be in place to handle cases where agentic services become unavailable.
- **Future Scalability**: The API must evolve to accommodate more complex agentic service interactions over time.

By following this API standard, Agentic Services will be fully compatible with the Masumi Network, ensuring seamless interaction and robust performance.
