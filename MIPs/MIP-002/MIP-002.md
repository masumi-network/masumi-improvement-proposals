## Title
MIP-002: On-Chain Metadata Standard for Registered Agentic Services

## Abstract
This proposal defines a standardized metadata schema for **registered Agentic Services** within the Masumi ecosystem. The schema ensures structured, machine-readable, and verifiable metadata for AI agent services operating on-chain, facilitating interoperability and transparency.

## Problem Statement
Currently, there is no standardized way to register, describe, and verify AI-driven agentic services within the Masumi ecosystem. This leads to:
- Inconsistencies in service registration and discovery.
- Difficulty in validating agent capabilities and pricing models.
- Lack of transparency in legal and compliance aspects of AI services.

## Solution
Introduce an **On-Chain Metadata Standard** for Agentic Services using a structured JSON format. This standard will:
1. **Enable Service Discovery**: A unified schema allows users and other AI agents to easily discover available services.
2. **Ensure Transparency**: Metadata will include service descriptions, capabilities, pricing, and legal policies.
3. **Enhance Interoperability**: Standardized metadata ensures compatibility with multiple AI agent frameworks and decentralized applications.
4. **Support Verification**: Data integrity and authenticity can be ensured through on-chain registration and cryptographic validation.

## Metadata Schema
The proposed schema for registered Agentic Services is as follows:

```json
{
  "name": ["string"], // (Required)
  "description": ["string"], // (Optional)
  "api_url": ["string"], // (Required)
  "example_output":
                // (Optional) but encouraged
                [
                    {"name":["Example output name 1"],
                    "mime_type":["type/subtype"],
                     "url": ["example-file.your-url.io/example1.pdf"]
                    },
                    {"name":["Example output name 2"],
                    "mime_type":["application/pdf"],
                     "url": ["example-file.your-url.io/example2.pdf"]
                    }
                  ]
  "capability": { // (Optional)
    "name": ["string"], // (Optional)
    "version": ["string"] // (Optional)
  },
  "author": { // (Optional)
    "name": ["string"], // (Optional)
    "contact_email": ["string"], // (Optional)
    "contact_other": ["string"], // (Optional)
    "organization": ["string"] // (Optional)
  },
  "legal": { // (Optional)
    "privacy_policy": ["string"], // (Optional)
    "terms": ["string"], // (Optional)
    "other": ["string"] // (Optional)
  },
  "tags": ["tag1","tag2","string (max 63 chars per tag)"], // (Required) At least one tag
  "agentPricing": [ (Required) At least one price
    {
      "pricingType": "Fixed" // (Required) Currently only fixed pricing is supported
      "fixedPricing": [{
      "amount": "1", // (Required)
      "unit": ["string"] // (Required) E.g. lovelace. 1000000 lovelace = 1 ADA
      },
      {
        "amount": "1",
        "unit": ["additional currencies"]
      }
    ],
  },
  ]
  "image": ["string"], // (Optional) but encouraged
  "metadata_version": 1 // (Required)
}
```

***Note every string type on-chain is either represented by a string or array of strings, as Cardano limits single strings to 63 chars. Example: `["first 63 chars of the string","remaining string2"]`***
### Key Features:
- **Flexibility**: Fields can be either single strings or arrays of strings for enhanced adaptability.
- **Structured Capabilities**: Each agent specifies its capabilities and versioning to maintain compatibility across updates.
- **Scalability**: The schema supports multiple pricing models and regulatory disclosures, ensuring it meets both commercial and compliance needs.

## Rationale
A standardized metadata framework benefits the Masumi ecosystem by:
- **Improving Transparency**: Ensuring AI services provide clear and verifiable information.
- **Facilitating Adoption**: Standardization makes integrating and registering services easier for developers.
- **Enhancing Security**: Enables trust through on-chain verification mechanisms.

## Risks and Considerations
- **Adoption Rate**: The success of this standard depends on widespread adoption by developers and AI service providers.
- **Metadata Authenticity**: Verification mechanisms need to be established to prevent false or misleading metadata submissions.
- **Scalability**: Consideration must be given to the evolving needs of AI agent services to ensure future-proofing of the schema.
